### About maps

Because we need to import an external library to render the map (that is not working for notebooks hosted on GitHub) , I convert the .ipynb file to .html to bypass this problem. 

If you're having trouble rendering Jupyter Notebook files in static HTML, you can convert the file locally on the command line by using the nbconvert command:

$ jupyter nbconvert --to html NOTEBOOK-NAME.ipynb
